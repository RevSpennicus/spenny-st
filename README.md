This is my personal configuration of lukesmithxyz's fork of st (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st). Not much is really changed other than making the default font Space Mono because I find it more appealing, as well as changing the colorscheme to fit better with my dwm config (https://github.com/RevSpennicus/spenny-dwm). My .Xdefaults file is included, which has stripped out all the themes included in Luke's. Really, you might as well just go download Luke's unless you really like my specific theme lol.
